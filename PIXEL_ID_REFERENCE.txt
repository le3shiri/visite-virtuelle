2. The pixel is already configured as a fallback in lib/fbpixel.js

3. Build and deploy to production:
   npm run build
   npm start

4. Verify the pixel is working:
   - Open your production site
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Filter by "facebook"
   - Navigate between pages
   - You should see requests to facebook.com/tr
